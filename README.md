INTRODUCTION

This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic  
These datasets can also be found in the 'data' folder.
This project can be used as a practice on how to use different plots and statistics. 

REQUIREMENTS

This project was coded on Python through Jupyter Notebook, of which can be found in the folder 'src'.

CONTENT

In the folder 'results', we explore different hypotheses from the data using exploratory data analysis.

1. Hypothesis 1: Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger.
2. Hypothesis 2: Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender.
3. Hypothesis 3: Determine if the survival rate is associated to the age.
4. Hypothesis 4: Relation between passengers who DID NOT survive and class of the passenger.

The data cleaning process is also described in the folder 'doc'.
